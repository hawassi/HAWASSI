## HAWASSI (Hamiltonian Wave-Ship & Structure Interaction) simulates phase resolved waves for coastal and ocean environments.

HAWASSI is a software package for the simulation of realistic waves in wave tanks (1HD), i.e. long-crested waves, and short-crested waves (2HD) with a directional spectrum to simulate waves in oceanic and
coastal areas, and in complicated areas with break waters and in harbours with (partial) reflections from walls with prescribed reflection properties. Copyright © 2015 LabMath-Indonesia

## Pre-built binaries and documentation [MATLAB version]

Pre-built binaries (executables) of all the HAWASSI programs for Windows (x64) can be found in the `Releases` section of the project for each version (starting from v1.0.0), along with the documentations and test cases.

The HAWASSI standalone program requires MCR installer for version MATLAB R2018a for Windows operating system 64bit. The MCR installer can be downloaded directly from the MATLAB website: http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/; after downloading install the MCR by double clicking the installer and following the instruction in the installation wizard. 

Alternatively, you can run the HAWASSI source code in MATLAB v2018a.

HAWASSI with C language code will be available in this GitHub soon.
